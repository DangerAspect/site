## Who

DangerAspect, aka [Joey](https://joeyfoo.com/). They/them.

(It's a somewhat obscure railway reference: in railway signalling parlance, you would refer to a signal with a red light as showing a _danger aspect_. Conversely, a green light would be a proceed aspect.)

## Description

Software developer, computer science and game design student, admin on [N3FS](http://n3fs.co.uk/), moderator on [the Rainbow6 Discord](https://discord.gg/Rainbow6) and the [R6 Round Table of Operators](https://r6roundtable.com/discord).
